            When you’re making responsive websites, there’s a lot of tweaking and testing to do.
            BrowserSync makes your workflow faster by synchronising URLs, interactions and code changes across multiple devices.
            It’s wicked-fast and totally free.

            <dt>Why isn&rsquo;t BrowserSync connecting with my project?</dt>
            <dd>99% of the time, it's because your web page doesn't have a `body` tag.
                In order for BrowserSync to connect properly the `body` tag must be present in your website. Alternatively you can provide a custom rule for the snippet using [snippetOptions]({{site.links.snippetOptions}})
            </dd>
            <dt>Which mode should I be running in?</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have simple HTML, CSS & Javascript files, you need the [server option]({{site.links.options}}-server).</li>
                    <li>If you already have an existing server setup (such as an Express app, Mamp, Rails etc, then you need the [proxy option]({{site.links.options}}-server).</li>
                    <li>If you intend to copy/paste the snippet into your website manually, you use the `snippet` mode. This is the default mode and is
                    achieved by omitting both the server & proxy options</li>
                </ul>
